# My dot files

  This is a repository for the configurations I use in Linux. My system
  is not meant to be featured on linux porn or anything similar. This is
  how I use my system everyday. It is always a work in progress but for
  the most part, pretty simple.

  I eventually will add some details and screenshots about how I put all
of this together.
